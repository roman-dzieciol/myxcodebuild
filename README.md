#myxcodebuild

The `xcodebuild` is the tool used to compile iOS & macOS projects from commandline.
 
We can write our own. It's simpler than you think!

## Why?

What if you could modify Xcode so it works just the way you want?

### ðŸšª Gain access to Xcode APIs

The Xcode is built from a lot of modular specialized frameworks. Use them in your app any way you want. 

* Modify project files programmaticaly
* Control compilation precisely
* Generate custom outputs efficiently
* Anything Xcode does, you can too, in your own way, in the language you love most

### ðŸ’¡ Learn how Xcode works internally

*Generate Objective-C pseudo-source-code and framework headers for all of Xcode.*

### ðŸ¦‹ Debug xcodebuild

*Run your custom `xcodebuild` from within Xcode to debug Apple's frameworks.*

### ðŸ“š Find undocumented features

*If you're curious, you'll find tons of useful undocumented features in Xcode.*

### ðŸš€ Add new features

*Modify the behavior of Xcode by subclassing and/or swizzling Apple's code.*

### ðŸ’¯ Remain always 100% compatible with Xcode

*And best of all, unlike 3rd party frameworks, it always works because it is the same code that Xcode IDE uses.*

***I can't wait to see what you will create*** ðŸ˜Š ***And there's so much more where that came from!***
